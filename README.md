# CSC6000-Basic-Programming
All projects from the Basic Programming course

# Contents
This repo will contain all of the projects from the modules that were done for this course.

# Module 1 
Asks the user its name, its age, and the current year, returns the possible year they were born in.

# Module 2
Asks the user a number as a string, ask which is the base (an Integer from 2 to 16), program should compute the binary and decimal representations of the number, then print it out as a string

# Module 3
Asks the user a scale factor a and a common ratio r, program informs the user if the Geometric Progression informed converges to a sum regardless of its number of elements.
Program should print out the first 3 elements of the GP and the computed sum.

# Module 4
Write a Python program to compute Arrangements of Multisets that:
      Asks the user a number of subsets (no smaller than 3, no greater than 8)
      Asks the user the size of each subset (from 1 to 5)
      Asks the user the total number of the arrangement (a number smaller than the sum of sizes of the subsets - n)
      Computes and prints the number of arrangements of k elements out of n, considering the subsets of size m

# Module 5
Python program to print Pascal's Triangle
Program asks the user the number of lines (limit from 4 to 8 lines) of the Pascal's Triangle.
Program has a function that computes the binomial coefficient of n and k, and this function is used to find the values of the cells of the Pascal's Triangle

# Module 6
Python program that receives two matrices to check if they are inverses of each other

# Module 7
Python program that receives information about a lottery game based on the player guessing k numbers out of n possible numbers
